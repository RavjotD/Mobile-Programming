# Journaling App

This Android Studio application project was completed through one of my courses. I utilized the skills we discovered in Android Studio to execute a full-stack Journaling application using Firebase as our back-end source.

## Project Scope
This application requires users to sign up and login in order to use the application. Users are free to create journal entries that get stored within the database system. They can also interact with accessibility features for editing and deleting personal information and entries.

## Tech Stack
- **Java**: The programming language used within Android Studio to develop the app.
- **Android Studio**: The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development.
- **Firebase**: Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) providing real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and login functionality for users to manage their accounts.
- **Create Journal Entries**: Users can create new journal entries.
- **Read Journal Entries**: Users can view their saved journal entries.
- **Update Journal Entries**: Users can edit existing journal entries.
- **Delete Journal Entries**: Users can delete unwanted journal entries.
